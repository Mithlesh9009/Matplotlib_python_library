# Matplotlib Python Library Project

This is my practice project where I explored and implemented different data visualization techniques using the **Matplotlib** library in Python.

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did
- Learned the basics of **Matplotlib** and how it works in Python.
- Created different types of plots:
  - Line plot
  - Bar chart
  - Scatter plot
  - Pie chart
  - Histogram
  - Subplots (multiple plots in one figure)
- Customized plots with:
  - Titles, labels, and legends
  - Colors and markers
  - Grid lines and styles
- Worked with **realistic data examples** to understand how visualizations help in analysis.
- Practiced in a Jupyter Notebook (`Mateplotlib.ipynb`) for step-by-step learning.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mithlesh9009/Matplotlib_python_library.git
   cd Matplotlib_python_library
